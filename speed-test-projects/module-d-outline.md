# Test Project Outline – Module D — Speed Challenge

This document outlines the description of Module D. It is circulated to the competitors and experts 3 months prior to the competition. This outline only describes the basic information of module D. The actual test project module will be created by external Test Project Developers using this outline as a guide. The module description will be presented on C-2 to all experts. The marking scheme will not be presented or supplied to competitors or experts during the competition.

## Introduction

Module D will focus on several mini test projects. The object of this module is to implement many smaller tasks from all topics in web development. The breakdown of points according to the Technical Description can be found in a table at the end of this document.

## Description of project and Tasks

The competitors will be asked to complete many smaller tasks.

Tasks can include but are not limited to implement PHP or JavaScript functions according to a provided documentation of that function, manipulate files and images using PHP, create and style a single UI element or parts of a website, or create interactive features with JavaScript.

All tasks will be categorized into three levels according to the estimated time it takes to complete them: easy, medium, and hard. The different levels will award a different number of points for the completion of such a task.

## Assessment

This module will be fully automated unit and end-to-end tested by:
- PHPUnit for PHP Tasks
- Mocha for JavaScript tasks that do not require user interactivity
- Cypress using Google Chrome for HTML/CSS tasks and JavaScript tasks that require user interactivity

The assessment using the automated tests will be done live during the competition and the real-time ranking will be visible to the visitors of the competition.

## Competition time

Competitors will have **1.5 hours** to complete module D.

Module D will be split into two independent parts (**0.5 hours** and **1 hour**) that will get completed on two different days.
