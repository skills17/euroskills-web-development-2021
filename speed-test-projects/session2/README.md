# Speed Test Project Session 2

In the speed challenge you will prove various skills in a range of small independent tasks.

This is the second session of two. You have exactly 60 minutes to complete as many tasks as possible.
The points you score in the speed challenge sessions will be added to your total points of the whole competition.

Your solutions will be automatically marked on a central server in real-time.

> All tasks can be tested by automated tests. To run them, change into their folder (e.g. cd `c3-module-f-speed-challenge-2/task*/`) and execute the command stated in each task under _Expected Result_.

> You can only change existing files in the `c3-module-f-speed-challenge-2/task*/src/` folders (where * is a number). All other files will be reverted for the review process.

## Tasks

The tasks do not have to be completed in the given order.
Please note that the points awarded per task are relative to their difficulty, meaning hard tasks will give more points than easy tasks.

| Task 2 - CSS Selectors               | easy       |
