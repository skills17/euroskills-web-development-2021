# Test Project Outline – Module A — Front-end Development

This document outlines the description of Module A. It is circulated to the competitors and experts 3 months prior to the competition. This outline only describes the basic information of module A. The actual test project module will be created by external Test Project Developers using this outline as a guide. The module description will be presented on C-2 to all experts. The marking scheme will not be presented or supplied to competitors or experts during the competition.

## Introduction

Module A will focus on front-end development and browser APIs. The object of this module is to create a website for a specified client. The breakdown of points according to the Technical Description can be found in a table at the end of this document.

## Description of project and Tasks

The competitors will be asked to create two websites for a specified client.

The first website focuses on client-side interactivity with various browser APIs that can include but are not limited to the Geolocation API and the HTML Drag and Drop API. Detailed requirements, as well as images, icons, text, and other media to use, will be provided by the client.

For the second website, competitors will be asked to create a static "one-page" website for the same client. It has to implement responsive design, use different types of media, and conform with accessibility standards. The client will supply the competitors with a defined website structure and will therein define all the sections of the website. The client will also provide all content for the website, such as text, images, and other media.

The responsiveness will be evaluated using three different viewports: mobile, tablet, and desktop. The exact resolutions will be described in the actual module description.

No server-side framework will be allowed for module A but client-side libraries can be used. CSS preprocessors may be used. Framework and library availability will be limited and will be decided by all experts using the EuroSkills forums.

## Assessment

Module A will be assessed using the latest stable version of Google Chrome and Firefox. HTML and CSS will be assessed using W3C validators. Accessibility will be tested using axe.

Where possible, automated end-to-end tests with Cypress will be used to assess measurement marks.

## Competition time

Competitors will have **6.5 hours** to complete module A.
