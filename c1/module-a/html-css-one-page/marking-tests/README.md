# Cypress Example

When running the tests, all files within the `./src` folder are served from `http://localhost:3000`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Running tests

Open Cypress in interactive mode:
```bash
npm start
```

Run tests once and print results with achieved points:
```bash
npm test
```

Run tests and get results as JSON:
```bash
npm run test:json
```
