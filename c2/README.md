# C2 Test Project â€” API Development & Consumption

## Introduction

Event organizers are planning a music festival in and around Graz with many different concerts.
Some concerts are also performed multiple times on different days.

To start with the presale, they need a website that allows the visitors to book their tickets and seats.
It should be split into a frontend and separate API to later also allow connecting their app to this application.

Since the functionality of this website is crucial to their success, important requirements are covered by automated tests.

## Description of project and tasks

The project is split into two phases:
- phase one (morning, 3 hours) for building the API using a PHP framework and MySQL database
- phase two (afternoon, 2.5 hours) for building the frontend parts using HTML/CSS and a JavaScript framework, consuming the API developed in phase one

When phase two starts, an API implementation will be provided so focus can be put on the frontend.

## Phase one - PHP API Development
